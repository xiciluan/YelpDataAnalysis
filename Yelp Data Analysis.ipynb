    "1. Provide recommendations on specific business attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Preprocessing on the business data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Applying ANOVA for testing different attributes' statistical difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using histogram to staightforwardly compare the scaled ratings.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Provide recommendations based on the reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Preprocessing the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Drawing WordCloud to intuitively show the frequently mentioned useful words.\n",

    "### Pre-processing Business Data\n",
    "In this section, the business attributes for each business and the corresponding star rating from *business.json* are used for analyses. There are 16,541 business IDs and the 10 business attributes studied include **Business Parking**, **Restaurants Delivery**, **Restaurants Reservations**, **Outdoor Seating**, **Noise Level**, **Restaurants Take Out**, **Restaurants Price Range**, **WiFi**, **Bike Parking** and **Restaurants Good For Groups**. \n",
    "The proportions of missing values in this subset of variables are calculated and there is no missing value for star rating. Overall, there is approximately 21% of missing values in the 10 business attributes and the following table shows the proportion of missing values for each attribute. Each attribute has < 35% of missing values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since some businesses have missing attributes, the star ratings between businesses with no missing attribute and businesses with at least *n* (*n* = 1,..,10) missing attributes are compared using two-sample t-test. The significant p-values from the corresponding test suggest that there is a difference in star ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average star rating for businesses with less than *n* missing values in business attributes and at least *n* missing values in business attributes are also compared using Welch two-sample t-test since Levene's Test shows that the two samples have unequal variances (p-value < $2.2\\times 10^{-16}$). The significant p-values from the corresponding test suggest that there is a difference in star ratings. An example of Welch two-sample t-test results for bussiness with less than 5 missing values in business attributes and at least 5 missing values in business attributes is as shown below.\n",

    "## Review Analysis\n",
    "### Preprocessing Text Data\n",
    "#### Vectorizing - TF-IDF\n",
    "Before we got stared with specific models, we had several steps to prepare our text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step would be vectorizing. The words needed to be encoded as vectors of integers to use as input to an algorithm. We used TF-IDF to achieve this goal. TF-IDF stands for “Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency”, which are the word frequency scores that try to highlight words that are more interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically this method reduced values of common word that are used in different documents. And we used TfidfVectorizer to finish vectorizing texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature extraction\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms can’t take in straight text, so we will create a matrix of numerical values to represent our text. As specific word has meaning but when we combine group of words the meaning might get changed, we should also decide on which n-gram to use. Finally, unigram should be the choice by taking into consideration of complexity of algorithm and effects of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tackling Missing Data\n",
    "For the review data set, there are two kinds of varibales, the star ratings of the restruants and the vectorized reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Missing on ratings\n",
    "    - There is no way we can imputate on people's reviews. In this case we delete this data in the review analysis part.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Missing on response varible\n",
    "    - We establish a simple Naive Bayes model based on the data with no missing value. The response variable is the star ratings and the predictors are the vectorized reviews. The training accuracy and test accuracy of the model is 61% and 63%, indicating that our that our model does not suffer from overfitting. The relatively low accuracy of this model is due to the fact that the number of our target catogory is 5, increasing the difficulty of our model to precisely put one review to the respective rating category. Apart from this, this model makes sense and could be used to fill out the missing values with missing value on star ratings. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Doc2Vec Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of Doc2Vec Model can be summarized according to *Le and Mikolov(2014)*, “every paragraph is mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in matrix D and every word is also mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in matrix W. The paragraph vector and word vectors are averaged or concatenated to predict the next word in a context… The paragraph token can be thought of as another word. It acts as a memory that remembers what is missing from the current context — or the topic of the paragraph.”\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we apply the DMC(Distributed Memory Concatenation) model, where the paragraph vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the task of inferring a center word based on context words and a context paragraph. More importantly, the DMC model has the inner function **most_similar**. That is, after training over a DMC model (*model_dmc*), if we query for *model_dmc.is_similar('good')* it will return words including perfect, terrific, incredible, etc. This is an extremely useful feature because for instance if we find the word 'avocado' important for getting high reviews, by finding its similar words (according to the result: guacamole, pinapple, etc.), we can further suggests the owners also includes these similar gradients to their menus. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for Determining Words' Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "After find some key words, the next thing we should do is to set up rules to determine whether this word is significant in terms of improving/decreasing resturants' ratings. Here, we set up two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The proportion of the positive ratings is 0.1 larger than the proportion of positive ratings in the review data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The proportion of the positive words nearby compared with the negative words nearby is 90% larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Histograms Comparing Scaled Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the example of \"truffle fries\" to verify that it is important in positive ratings and therefore resturants are recommended to include it in their menu. The y-axis the plot is the proportion of the rating with the words \"truffle fries\" minus the proportion of the rating given the whole review data set. According to the plot, the proportion of the 3, 4 and 5 ratings are all larger while that of 1 and 2 ratings are smaller, indicating the positivity of \"truffle fries\". What's more, after finding both the positive and negative words nearby, the proportion of positive words is 95%, further indicating that business owners are adviced to include this in their menu for higher ratings.

    "### Provide recommendation based on the business attributes they provided\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we checked if there were any missing values in the attributes. We had several hypothesis that the number of missing attributes would affect the ratings of restaurants. By testing the hypothesis, reducing missing values would significantly improve the ratings of fast food restaurant.(检验结果) And within the attributes we researched, we found to improve the quality of attributes would also result in better ratings. For example, the ratings of stores with free WiFi were significantly higher than that of stores with paid WiFi.(检验结果)Based on these results, We encourage business owners to refine their attributes as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract important features from their reviews and provide suggestions on it\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we extracted information from the reviews of each fast food restaurant and gave them specific advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we first decided on a list of keywords. This list contained words from 12 aspects, including time, service, salty, oily, overcook, undercook, bland, vinegary, restroom, floor, napkin, and environment. Next, we calculated the proportion of the appearance of these words in the positive and negative reviews. Basically, we calculated the frequency scores of these specific words. For example, when calculating the score of \"filthy\", which indicating sanitation problem of a restaurant, we counted how many times this word appear in a negative review and adjusted the score by the length of the review. Adding up all the scores in a negative reviews would result in our final score. Sometimes a word appears in the positive reviews, and we would subtract some scores from the total score of a specific word. As a matter of fact, the higher the proportion score was, the more serious the problem was with that specific restaurant. By setting some threshold on the proportion scores, we confirmed the severity of the problems and gave specific suggestions in our APP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and Drawbacks\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The recommendations we give are feasible and actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For verifying the significance of certain attributes or words, we introduce different methods, guranteeing the accuracy of our measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Taking into consideration different people's rating preference and data imbalance when comparing ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The results are clearly plotted and highly readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Shiny APP we create guarantees great user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks and Future Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For predicting ratings, the prediction accuracy could increase. This can be solved by extracting or including more important features (e.g. length of the text) and using more advanced models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Doc2Vec model can only find similar uni-gram word of the given word(s). \n",
